After the release of Portus 2.1 some users notified us about some regressions
and bugs. We've been handling those as well as including some small
improvements. You can read more about that in the
[release notes](https://github.com/SUSE/Portus/releases/tag/2.1.1). We urge
users of the 2.1 release to upgrade to 2.1.1 as soon as possible.

### The road ahead

As we wrote in the [last blog post](/2016/09/30/portus-2.1.html), we are not
particularly happy on how we handled some things during the development of the
2.1 release. For this reason, we will maintain
[this dedicated page](/docs/release-schedule.html) explaining what to expect
from new releases, the exact dates, and the overall goals of the releases to
come.
