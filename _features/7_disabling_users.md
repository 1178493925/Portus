## Disabling users

Any admin can disable users. The only restriction is that an admin user cannot
disable itself if it's the only remaining admin in the application. You can
disable any user by accessing the "User" panel in the "Admin" page. Just like
this:

![Disabling](/build/images/docs/disabling-user.png)

No data will be lost by disabling a user. The only thing that will happen is
that disabled users won't be able to login into Portus. This is what a disabled
user will see when trying to login:

![Disabled](/build/images/docs/disabled-user.png)

Of course, in the same way that an admin can disable a user, an admin can
enable back a disabled user. The procedure is exactly the same: just click
the "Enabled" toggle again.
