## suse.github.io/Portus

The `gh-pages` branch contains the code of the web site of Portus. It has been
built with [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). You can also get your
hands dirty with this locally. Since this is built on top of
[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), you just have to type the following:

```
$ bundle
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```

### Gulp tasks (if you are editing the assets)

If you are modifiying Less, JS or images in the /assets folder, you need to run GULP in your console in order to preprocess CSS, minify JS and compress the images.

All you need to do is type the following:

```
$ gulp
```

After that, you will have the site available at `localhost:4000`.
