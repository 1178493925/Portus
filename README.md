## suse.github.io/Portus

The `gh-pages` branch contains the code of the web site of Portus. It has been
built with [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). You can also get your
hands dirty with this locally. Since this is built on top of
[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), you just have to type the following:

```
$ bundle
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```

After that, you will have the site available at `localhost:4000`.
