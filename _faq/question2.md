Portus is an open source authorization service and user interface for your
on-premise Docker registry. Portus will add a fine-grained set of permissions on
top of your registry in order to make access more secure and
controlled. Moreover, Portus offers a web UI on top of your registry that will
give you a clear overview of the images and tags that are stored in your
registry.
