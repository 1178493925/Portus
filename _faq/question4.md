<p>
We are not going to lie: the deployment of Portus can be a daunting task
considering the amount of moving pieces and the complexity of some of these
pieces. For this reason, it's easy to have errors on your deployment due to some
missing step or some misunderstanding. Because of this, we have had quite some
questions on this regard, or invalid bug reports. If you are facing any problem
in Portus, consider these steps:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
First of all, check that your question is not already answered in the
official <a href="/documentation.html">documentation</a>. If you were following
a page in the documentation, make sure that you followed it step by step.
</li>

<li>
Make sure that your question is not already answered in our
<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/portus-dev">Google Group</a>.
If this is not the case, feel free to ask your question there, we will try to be
as diligent as possible.
</li>

<li>
Another possibility is to check whether your issue is already known to us. You
can take a look <a href="https://github.com/SUSE/Portus/issues">here</a>. If you
find a suitable issue, feel free to add a comment with your specific case as
specified
<a href="https://github.com/SUSE/Portus/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#reporting-issues">here</a>.
</li>

<li>
Lastly, if you have gone through all the previous steps and you are sure that
this is an issue on Portus itself, then submit a new issue as specified
<a href="https://github.com/SUSE/Portus/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#reporting-issues">here</a>.
</li>
</ul>
